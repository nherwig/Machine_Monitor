Developing an Artificial Intelligence Model to Predict Mechanical Failure Mechanisms on Electrical Motors Utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) Vibration Sensors 

Problems - 
The AnomAlert system currently in use is proprietary technology.​
The data it extracts, the reports it makes, and the methods of analysis are not owned by machinemonitor.​
As such, machinemonitor cannot tailor fit its analysis to its client's needs.​
On top of this, each reporting cycle consists of heavy timing overhead.

Solutions - 
Machine monitor proposes the use of two technologies to present an alternative to this:​
Treon Sensors in an IoT Framework constantly provide data,​
Machine learning models are built and run to continuously monitor said data with a dashboard for visualization.
With these two technologies, machinemonitor can replace the AnomAlert system and drive direct value to their clients.

Folders - 
DATA_COLLECTION - It stores the collected data from different fault scenarios
Data_Extraction -  It stores the Python files for continuous data extraction and processing.
Machine_Learning_Models - It stores the Python notebooks for our CNN and Random Forrest model as well as the developed model and Python files to use the developed models.
