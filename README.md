Developing an Artificial Intelligence Model to Predict Mechanical Failure Mechanisms on Electrical Motors Utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) Vibration Sensors 

Problems - 
The AnomAlert system currently in use is proprietary technology.​
The data it extracts, the reports it makes, and the methods of analysis are not owned my machine monitor.​
As such, machinemonitor cannot tailor fit its analysis to their client's needs.​
On top of this, each reporting cycle consists of heavy timing overhead.

Solutions - 
Machinemonitor proposes the use of two technologies to present an alternative to this:​
Treon Sensors in an IoT Framework constantly providing data,​
Machine learning models built and run to continuously monitor said data with an dashboard for visualisation.
With these two technologies, machinemonitor can replace the AnomAlert system and drive direct value to their clients.
