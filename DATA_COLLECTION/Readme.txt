Normal: Data was collected by running the rig motor without any additional faults. The experimental setup was established to ensure parts of the motor were set up correctly, before the motor was initiated and set to run. The group collected sets of data for a normal running motor across various loads, ranging from 0 to 0.620 amps of brake current.  

Loose Foundation: The experiment set the 6 foundation bolts connecting the electric motor to the steel base excessively loosened. The motor was then initiated, and data was from that point collected and labelled. Here the group collected sets of data for a motor running with loose foundation with varying loads ranging from 0 to 0.620 amps of brake current and varying severity in loose foundation by loosening different individual screws by different turns.   

No Run: This category of data was collected whilst the motor was not operational. I.e. the motor shaft was at a standstill, power turned off and sensors in place while data was collected.

Overload: The electric load applied across the motor was increased past the motor’s maximum load (0.620amps).  The group collected sets with varying load with brake current varying from 0.650 amps to 0.750 amps.  

Uneven base: One corner is tilted such that the base is off-centre across two dimensions. Data was collected for the motor running on uneven base with varying loads ranging from 0 to 0.620 amps and varying the severity of the tilt using uniform sizes of wood.
